# SQLite_Database
I have build an inventory database in which there are three tables namely products, categories and suppliers. Two columns of the products table have been referenced from the categories and suppliers tables using Foreign Keys. I have also made a column for photos, which is basically made from converting the image file to the binary file (code is written in the add image file) and so, the photo column has BLOB datatype.
Then, I have make a normal python file(normalquery.py) for executing normal SQL commands using VsCode.
Also, I have write the code for exporting the product to the csv file in the (forcsv.py) file
